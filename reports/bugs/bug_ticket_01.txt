 - Entering value "1098" on any field results in an Equilateral triangle, regardless of the other fields

Environment:

Steps to reproduce:
 - Enter integer value "1098" on any field
 - Either enter any other integer values in the other fields or leave them empty
 - Click on "Find out!" button

Actual behaviour:
 - App always shows the message "This is an Equilateral Triangle!"
