Title:
 - Entering a value greater than 100000 on any field results in a Scalene triangle, regardless of the other fields

Environment:
 - App executed locally on Chrome version 121.0.6167.160

Preconditions:
 - Launch app in clean state

Steps to reproduce:
 - Enter any integer value greater than 100000 on any field
 - Either enter any other integer values in the other fields or leave them empty
 - Click on "Find out!" button

Expected behaviour:
 - App should offer the correct output, either the triangle type or the "Not a triangle" message

Actual behaviour:
 - App always shows the message "This is a Scalene Triangle!"
